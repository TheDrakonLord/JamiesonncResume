# JamiesonncResume

## What this is:
To demonstrate my own coding abilities in a tangible manner, I created a website that I then export as a PDF to serve as my resume. The original intent is that I would also have a website online at the same time. However, currently I've taken the site down due to costs. I hope to have it back online soon.  For now, I am still using a localhost version of the site to produce my resume.

This repsitory contains the source code used to create the resume.

## PDF output instructions:
use a tool such as the Print Edit WE extension (use the web style) for firefox and delete the footer element. Then use Adobe PDF as the printer (or similar tool) with the following settings:
- Color: Color
- Pages: All
- Paper Size: A4
- Scale: Scale - 69%
- Margins: None
- Print Backgrounds: Enabled
